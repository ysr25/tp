## Project: Bagel

Bagel is a desktop flashcard application based off [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/). 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add links to flashcards. (Pull request [\#82]())
  * What it does: Allows the user to add an optional link to a flashcard.
  * Justification: The user can refer to local files or online sources easily by clicking on the link added. 

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true)
