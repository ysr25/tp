## Project: Bagel

Bagel is a desktop flashcard application used for studying and memorisation purposes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an add command that allows the user to view the list of flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to add a flashcard to the total list of flashcards.
  * Justification: This feature is a basic critical function for an MVP for Bagel, without this function, there will be no way to have any flashcards.

* **New Feature**: Added a delete command that allows the user to delete a specified index of a flashcard from the list of flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a flashcard from the list of flashcards.
  * Justification: This feature is a basic critical function for Bagel, without this function, there will be no way to remove any flashcards.
