## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add t/TITLE`, TITLE is the parameter which can be used.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/p-value tag/Definition` or as `t/p-value`.<br>
  e.g. `[s/1]` is optional.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. in `[tag/TAG]…`, can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/Definition, tag/Formula tag/Important` etc.

* User should supply the index of the flashcard behind commands.<br>
  e.g. `view 1`, `delete 10`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* Although it is not recommended to supply duplicate parameters, they will still be accepted. However,
only the last parameter supplied will be considered.
  e.g. if the command entered is `add t/title 1 t/title 2 d/description`, the title of the flashcard added will be
  `title 2`, as only `t/title 2` will be considered.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: Where is the data from Bagel stored?<br>
**A**: By default, a data folder will be created in the same folder as the `bagel.jar` file.
After running the app for the first time, you can change the file path by editing `preferences.json`
in the same folder directly.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install Bagel in the other computer and copy-and-paste the data folder into the same folder
as the `bagel.jar` file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Glossary

* __Duplicate flashcard__: Two flashcards that have the same title and description are considered duplicate flashcards.
Duplicate flashcards are disallowed, even if they have different links, set numbers, or tags. This is to ensure that users will not make a mistake
while adding flashcards, and to prevent confusion.

* __Mainstream OS__: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

* __Set__: It acts similarly to a folder in the real world. To categorize your flashcards, and maximise your efficiency,
do be sure to make use of the 'set' feature to place flashcards into different sets.
